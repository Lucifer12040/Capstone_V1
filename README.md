# Java Blackjack Game
##**About:** This is a Java-based Blackjack game developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Swing or JavaFX, and it simulates a casino-style Blackjack experience with:

- Smart dealer logic

- Card visuals

Organized code structure via multiple Java classes

(⚠️ Note: Make sure to update your resource file paths (e.g., images, sound effects, etc.) based on your local directory before running.)

# # Note:
External tools and automated coding assistants were referenced throughout development, along with logic from prior projects and personal repositories. Other key sources include StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, and the Oracle Java documentation. Commit history contains documented steps that may help in tracing the process.

# # File Structure
A coding assistant was consulted to determine a clean and effective file structure for better readability and maintainability. Files were grouped based on their type and relevance.
